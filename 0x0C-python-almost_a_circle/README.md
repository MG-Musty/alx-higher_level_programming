# :books: Python - Almost a circle :pen:

> In this project, I encapsulated skills in Python object-oriented programming by coding three connected classes to represent rectangles and squares. I wrote my own test suite using the unittest module to test all functionality for each class.

The three classes involved utilizing the following Python tools:

* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Getter/Setter
* Class method
* Static method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Read/Write file

You will also learn about:

* ```args``` and ```kwargs```
* Serialization/Deserialization
* JSON

## File Structure

* [models](models)
  * [base.py](models/base.py) - Contains the base class `Base`
  * [rectangle.py](models/rectangle.py) - Contains the class `Rectangle`, a subclass of `Base`
  * [square.py](models/square.py) - Contains the class `Square`, a subclass of `Rectangle`
* [tests](tests)
  * [test_models](tests/test_models)
    * [test_base.py](tests/test_models/test_base.py) - Contains all tests pertaining to class `Base`
    * [test_rectangle.py](tests/test_models/test_rectangle.py) - Contains all tests pertaining to class `Rectangle`
    * [test_square.py](tests/test_models/test_square.py) - Contains all tests pertaining to class `Square`
* [other files](test)
  *[0-main.py]
  *[1-main.py]
  *[2-main.py]
  *[" " " " "]
  *[" " " " "]
